    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2">Privacy Note: Project Focus & Data Security</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-200 mb-4">
        SurgiMind is a **B.Tech Final Year Project** developed by Mohd Rayyan, Syed Saad Ahmed, and Mohammed Sofiyaan from JNTUH. 
        This platform is purely for **educational and research simulation**.
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2">1. Data Handling & Anonymization (Simulated)</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**No Real Patient Data:** The application handles simulated, anonymized clinical data (placeholder reports, mock video streams).</li>
        <li>**Data Segregation:** Simulated case files are segregated by surgeon and are not publicly visible.</li>
        <li>**Anonymized Logs:** System metrics (e.g., model usage, processing times) are recorded in anonymized form for performance analysis only.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2 mt-4">2. Security & Access Control (Simulated)</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**Encryption:** All data fields in our mock environment are secured using industry-standard simulation of **end-to-end encryption** and storage.</li>
        <li>**Surgeon-Only Access:** Authentication is simulated to ensure only authorized users (surgeons) access the platform. Access tokens are simulated to expire periodically.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2 mt-4">3. Data Usage & Commercial Policy</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**Research Only:** Data generated within the platform is solely for academic purposes (JNTUH B.Tech Project).</li>
        <li>**No Commercial Use:** Data is **not** shared, sold, or used for any commercial or external third-party applications, strictly adhering to academic integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2">Terms of Service: Academic Use & Liability</h4>
    <p class="text-sm text-gray-200 mb-4">
        By accessing this platform, you acknowledge the following terms which govern its use:
    </p>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2">1. Non-Clinical Warning & Liability</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**Non-Clinical Use:** SurgiMind must **NEVER** be used for actual diagnosis, patient treatment, or real surgical guidance. It is a research prototype.</li>
        <li>**No Medical Advice:** The summaries, checklists, and procedural confidence scores provided are for **simulation/educational reference only** and should not replace professional medical judgment.</li>
        <li>**Liability Waiver:** The project creators (Mohd Rayyan, Syed Saad Ahmed, Mohammed Sofiyaan) and JNTUH hold **no liability** for any clinical decisions made based on the platform's simulated outputs.</li>
        </ul>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2 mt-4">2. Software and Model Limitations</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**Prototype Status:** The application is provided "as is" with known limitations and bugs typical of final year academic projects.</li>
        <li>**Simulated Accuracy:** The reported AI model accuracies (e.g., 94.8%) are simulated for demonstration purposes.</li>
        <li>**Compliance:** This application does **not** comply with real-world HIPAA, GDPR, or FDA regulations, as it is non-operational academic software.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-accent-green mb-2 mt-4">3. User Conduct</h4>
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-200 space-y-1">
        <li>**Authorized Use:** This platform is intended strictly for authorized surgical personnel involved in the associated academic study.</li>
        <li>**Misuse Prohibited:** Users must not attempt to upload real patient identifiable information or attempt to exploit the platform's simulated security features.</li>
