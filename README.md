# Surgical Mind

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
SurgiMind is a research and educational project. It is not approved for clinical use.
**Surgical Mind** is an AI-powered system for **surgical workflow analysis**. It integrates medical report detection, surgical tool recognition, and procedural workflow analysis to support precision, safety, and efficiency in the operating room.

## Features

* üìÑ **Report Detection & Summarization** ‚Äì Extracts and summarizes key surgical reports.
* üîß **Tool Detection** ‚Äì Identifies instruments in real time during operations.
* üìä **Workflow Analysis** ‚Äì Measures surgical areas, recommends procedures, and maps the workflow.

## Tech Stack

* **AI / ML**: PyTorch, YOLOv8, LSTM/GRU
* **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
* **Backend**: Flask / FastAPI
* **Frontend**: Streamlit or React.js
* **Deployment**: Docker, AWS/GCP/Heroku

## Project Pipeline

1. **Data Preparation** ‚Äì Collect and preprocess surgical datasets.
2. **Model Training** ‚Äì Train models for tool detection and workflow classification.
3. **Integration** ‚Äì Build a modular pipeline combining detection and analysis.
4. **Visualization** ‚Äì Interactive interface with real-time annotations.
5. **Deployment** ‚Äì Dockerized backend with frontend app for demonstrations.

## Use Cases

* Assisting surgeons with **real-time decision support**.
* Improving **surgical training** with automated insights.
* Enhancing **patient safety** through workflow monitoring.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/surgical-mind.git
cd surgical-mind
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run backend
python app.py  

# Run frontend (example: Streamlit)
streamlit run ui.py  
```

Upload surgical videos/reports to see **tool detection, report summaries, and workflow insights** in action.

## Future Work

* Gesture recognition for advanced workflow mapping
* Integration with robotic-assisted surgery systems
* Enhanced visualization dashboards
